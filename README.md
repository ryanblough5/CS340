1) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

A good way to write the programs to ensure that they function properly is to make sure that you test the code to make sure that it is working properly. The more that you test the more that you can ensure that proper functionality, and if something is not working it is better to fix it early rather than after it has already been launched.

2) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

A good way to approach a problem as a computer scientist is to look at everything from the point of view as the user. When the user is using the application it is better if they don't think about how it is coded and are just concerned about it working. So, as a developer that is the best the approach to writing the code.

3) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists analyze and interpulate data and make sure that the data that was interpreted is functioning properly as it should once it is inputted. It helps companies because it allows them to seamlessly touch base with there customer base and not have to worry about becoming disjoined from them.
